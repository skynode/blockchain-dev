----Demonstration of Bitcoin Micropayment Proxy Using the 21.co API----

This client will invoke a micropayments proxy server, payments_handler.py,
when the client receives an HTTP status_code 402 from some service
running on some server to which an HTTP request has been made.
The payments-handler won't be activated play under any other scenario.
